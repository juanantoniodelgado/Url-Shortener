URL Shortener
=============

Mock-up project built in Symfony based on [FreeCodeCamp's idea](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/apis-and-microservices/apis-and-microservices-projects/url-shortener-microservice). 

Uses Base62 encoding to encrypt the current timestamp and uses it as a token url. The project has two ways to encrypt url's, one through an html form and the other one through a GET request which returns a JSON Response.

## Dependencies

* [Tuupola's base62 library](https://github.com/tuupola/base62)
