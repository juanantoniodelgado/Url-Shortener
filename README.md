URL Shortener
=============

Mock-up microservice built in Symfony based on [FreeCodeCamp's idea](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/apis-and-microservices/apis-and-microservices-projects/url-shortener-microservice). 

Uses Base62 encoding to encrypt the current timestamp and uses it as a token url.

## Dependencies

* [Tuupola's base62 library](https://github.com/tuupola/base62)
